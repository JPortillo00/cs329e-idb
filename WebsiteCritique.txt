Our Website

What did we do well?
The sorting and individual games and genre pages were done very nicely. Each section provided adequate detail on their 
respective subject and linked appropriately to the other model pages.

What did we learn?
We learned from our website how to implement a carousel for the main splash page. In addition, we figured out how to incorporate
bootstrap to make our streamer pages look nice.

What can we do better?
We could have added more features on the splash page to make it more appealing. In addition, we could have added more features to
the table pages. 

What puzzles us?
The javascript files we used were confusing due to the amount of code already written as well as our unfamiliarity with the 
language.


Their Website

What did they do well?
The splash and about page were done really nicely. The background image and the updated newsfeed on the splash page were very
fitting for the theme of their project. In addition, the about page structure was really well done. We liked how they listed each
team member and how click on their names lead to a personalized about section. 

What did we learn from their website?
We learned that you can incorporate updated news feeds to your website.

What can they do better?
They could have added more information on each subject page as well as add more features and links to showcase the place, people, and government seats.

What puzzles us about their website?
The navigation bar which had a dropdown feature when the window was reduced only worked for the splash page.
